       <br> 
        <h2>EOF stands for "end of file". It typically means that the Python interpreter has reached the end<br>
        of the program without completely executing all the code.<br>
        <br>
        Here are some common causes:
        <br>
          <li>
          fail to define a statement or expressions for our while/for loops
          <br>
          <br>
          <div class="a">
          i = 1<br>
          while i < 11:
            </div>
          <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            omit closing curley braces or brackets in our code
            <br>
            <br>
  
            <div class="a">

          <br>
          <div>SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal</div>
          <h2>EOL stands for End of Line Error which essentially means that the Python interpreter expected a character or<br>
          set of chracters to occur at a specific line but did not find them. This results in a syntax error. This particular <br>
        error deals with reading a string where the interpreter hits the end of line without a qoute. </h2>
